# Steps to build

1. Get nodejs. Install grunt globally ( `npm install -g grunt-cli` )
2. From the root folder, run `npm install` and then `grunt build`
3. Files will be generated in the `dist` folder, and the packaged extension in the packages folder
4. In chrome, enable developer mode and upload the unpacked extension from the dist folder
5. Visit a bunch of wiki pages for the index to build
6. In the address bar, type li <space> query. Select the suggestion and you are done
